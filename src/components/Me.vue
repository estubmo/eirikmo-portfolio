        I am a lifelong learner who enjoy exploring new technologies and approaches to web development. I am also an
        avid traveler, language learner, and I enjoy hiking up sunny mountains in my free time.

        I'm privileged enough to do all of my work remotely. And I can effectively communicate and collaborate with
        clients and team members remotely. This allows me to take on projects from anywhere in the world and deliver
        high-quality results.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like to contribute to Open Source projects, fixing bugs or adding features when there's something I need
        that is missing.
